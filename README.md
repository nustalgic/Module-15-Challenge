# Background

In this Challenge, I’ve been hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country. They want to increase their client portfolio—especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, I decide to create a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

## Technologies

The data we're analyzing comes from a jupyter notebook that we'll create and import files to. We'll be using Python to run and read our data. 

* [Amazon Lex](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/what-is.html)  - an AWS service for building conversational interfaces for applications using voice and text.

* [Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)  - an AWS service for to run code without provisioning or managing infrastructure. Simply write and upload code as a .zip file or container image.

* [jupyter] - (https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) - Helps us run our code and get the information we need from the data listed in csv files.


## Installation Guide

In order for us to get the data we need we must import pandas, plots and the csv files we want to observe.

```python
### Required Libraries ###
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
